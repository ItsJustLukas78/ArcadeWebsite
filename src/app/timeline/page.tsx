                  &emsp;We are an experienced and <span className="font-extrabold">completely student-run</span> high school club whose members work on both real life
                  engineering projects and participate in the VEX Robotics Competition.
                  Around <span className="font-extrabold">15 years old</span> now, our club takes pride in its members‚Äô teamwork and problem solving skills.
                  We also heavily emphasize the engineering design process and ensure that all members have knowledge of
                  such engineering aspects through our yearly seminars.

                  &emsp;Our club is driven by a strong passion for engineering. Due to this, we have always stressed the
                  importance of the <span className="font-extrabold">Engineering Design Process</span> and ensure that each and every one of our members
                  knows about proper design protocol through our Academy program. The <span className="font-extrabold">Gael Force Academy</span> program
                  displays another one of our priorities: sharing knowledge. We make sure that everyone has a place
                  in Gael Force, regardless of experience.

                  &emsp;We think that a good team has more than just a good bot. Our teams stress a <span className="font-extrabold">well-rounded design process</span>.
                  Each of our teams focuses on their <span className="font-extrabold">Documentation</span> just as much as their bot performance.
                  The process of properly documenting work ensures that the team gains a concrete understanding of the
                  multitude of engineering concepts that go into every bot. The documentation is used by new members and
                  the Gael Force Academy as a reference tool to teach and reflect on the design process using live examples
                  from our numerous teams.

                  &emsp;Our club has roots that run deep. When we started off, Gael Force Robotics consisted of a single team of robotics
                  enthusiasts. It was a club purely for those with a burning passion for innovation and deep knowledge of engineering.
                  Throughout the years, we‚Äôve managed to expand to a scale that none of the founding members could have imagined.
                  The club is now open to anyone with an interest, we can handle giving them the technical skills needed.

                  Many of them stay active in our Discord servers and will pop into meets and competitions whenever they are able to.
                  Their wisdom and input is highly respected and extremely valuable. They are a vital part of our teaching system
                  and many of them end up mentoring other VRC teams after they graduate in order to give back to the community that
                  allowed them to learn so much.
