# Welcome to our website!

Hello! My name is Lukas Somwong, and I am the webmaster for the Gael Force Robotics Club. I am a senior at Dublin High School, and I have been a member of the club since my sophomore year, spending time on both the 5327S and 5327K competitive teams.
I am deeply interested in pursuing a career in computer science and software engineering, and I love to apply my skills to build software that helps my community.

<br />

As the webmaster, I am responsible for maintaining and updating our website, working very closely to officers and members to ensure it meets
the needs of the club, and ensuring that the website will continue to be maintained by and serve the club for many years to come as newer generations take over.

<br />

I have been working on this website for the past few months, and I am excited to finally share it with you.
I built this website because I believed that our club needed a better way to communicate with our members, their families, and the community. With this website,
our club gains many new opportunities to share our story, showcase our accomplishments, reach out to more students who want to develop their engineering skills, provide
resources to our members and other competitors, gain sponsorships, and much more.

<br />
