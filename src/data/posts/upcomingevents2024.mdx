# GFR hosts events? Yes, we do!

Gael Force Robotics is a student-run organization that is proud to host a variety of events throughout the year, bringing together students from all over the Bay Area to compete, get involved in STEM, and have fun. We host a variety of events, including VEX Robotics Competitions, GirlPowered Events, and more. Check out our upcoming events below!

## Fall GFR Showcase

The Fall GFR Showcase is a great opportunity for students to learn more about Gael Force Robotics and meet existing members, especially if they are interested in joining the club. We will have a variety of stations demonstrating what a student might expect to do while on the club. This event is open to all middle and high school students, regardless of experience level.

## GirlPowered Workshop

The GirlPowered Workshop is an event designed to encourage young girls to get involved in STEM and robotics by providing them with a supportive and inclusive environment to learn and participate in hands-on activities. Participants will have the opportunity to learn the strategy of a robotics match, drive and program robots, build lifts, and more. Participants are encouraged to bring their friends to this event, but they will no doubt make some here!

## All-Inclusive Workshop
