# Battle of The Bay is taking place January 16, 2028

High School VEXV5 teams are **invited** to _Dublin High School_ to compete in our annual _state-qualifying_ robotics competition. Over 50 teams come
each year to battle it out on our fields. We provide large pits for teams to set up, concession stands for when competitors get hungry, and a thrilling
environment.

This is some **bold** and _italics_ text.

This is a list in markdown:

- One
- Two
